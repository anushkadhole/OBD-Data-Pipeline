# OBD-Style Data Processing Pipeline ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This project simulates a vehicle emissions compliance pipeline using Python and Power BI. It processes OBD-style logs, flags emission risks, and generates summary Excel reports and visualizations.

## Features

- Simulated vehicle log generation
- Emission risk detection based on thresholds
- Summary reports and pivot tables in Excel
- Visual analysis support for Power BI

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

2. Run the processor script:
```bash
cd scripts
python process_obd_logs.py
```

3. Open the Excel report from `outputs/reports/emissions_report.xlsx`.

## Power BI

Use the exported Excel report to build visual dashboards in Power BI.
